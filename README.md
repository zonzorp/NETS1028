# NETS1028 Linux Systems Security Course Resources

## Course Information
This course is part of the INSS program at Georgian College. The course outline is updated periodically and kept available online via the [Georgian College website](https://georgiancollege.ca). There is also a course syllabus with the details for each semester kept on the [Blackboard website](https://gc.blackboard.com) for the course.
There is no textbook for this course. Online help and documentation provide the reference material. An example link list that is actively maintained and covers much more than this course topic list can found at [https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection](https://github.com/0x4D31/awesome-threat-detection). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) is an excellent resource to use when examining an existing deployment to identify concerns.
We use multiple operating systems for our lab exercises and it is expected that students will run them in virtual machines under [VMWare](https://vmware.com).
