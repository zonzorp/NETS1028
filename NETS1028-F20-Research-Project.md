# NETS1028 Semester Research Project

## Collaboration
For this project, you may work alone, or in groups of up to 4. Once you have decided if you are working alone or in a group, send me an email so that I know who is working in groups with whom.

## Identify software and resources
Identify an Open Source graphical tool designed to provide a high level overview of system operation which runs on Linux and can examine and evaluate a Linux target system in a way that is useful for determining if there are security concerns with the target. Locate the vendor or community web sites and at least one other resource for installing, configuring, deploying, or using the software.

## Get approval *before proceeding*
When you have selected the software you are going to present, send me your choice via email for approval. Every project will need to do a distinct software package.

## Install and run the software
Obtain and install the current version of the software. Configure it and make it work. Once it has been running long enough to gather whatever information it is designed to gather, you are ready for the enxt step.

## Report on your results in a presentation
Create a brief presentation which describes the software, why you chose it, what it is good at, not good at, and whether you recommend it as a tool for helping secure one or more Linux systems.

## Presentation delivery and schedule
Your presentation should be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes, preferably more like 15, and you will be presenting it to the class during the second half of the semester. It is due by the end of reading week. The presentation order will be posted during reading week. When your presentation is ready, submit a PDF with your presentation slides on Blackboard. If you have done a video of your presentation, include a URL for the video in the Blackboard submission comments. If you have done a video, you will not need to present in person but your mark will then be solely based on the submitted slides and video. If you do a video, all group members must appear in the video, and all group members must present at least some part of the presentation.

## Grading
Marks will be given for several parts of your presentation as follows:

* Name and description of the software
* Vendor, community, or individual owning the software and what licensing it is under
* Supported platforms or host requirements and why you chose it
* How to obtain and install, any important install options to know about
* Screenshots of the software installed on your host, or demo on your host
* Great and not so great things about the software and your recommendations about it
* List of resources (downloads, plugins, extensions, addons, documentation, addons, demos, tutorials, reviews) for anyone contemplating using the software

This project will provide half of your assignment mark for the semester.

### Examples of software you might choose could be:

* PHP Server Monitor
* psacct, acct, and sar
* Monit & MMonit
* Monitorix
* Suricata
* Nagios
* nmon
* Collectl
* Icinga
* Observium
* Linux Dash
* Cacti
